# Cold-Waters-Campaigns-
A place for campaigns I want to experiment with or are finished


This is for any campaigns that I have worked on using created objects/files/locations that have been created by the DotMod team or the orignal developer team under Killerfish Games. 
If there are any issues with the campaigns, please reach out to me on Discord in the DotMod server under the same name here. I will be happy to assist in whatever way I can.

Installation Steps:

1: Download the most current release of DotMod available from https://github.com/DotModGroup/ColdWaters-DotMod/releases

2: Download the most current DotMod version here which will be updated as new DotMod versions come through

3: Replace the installed version of dotmod inside StreamingAssets with the downloaded version and replace any files
